WE have created the model based on the diagram displayed in properties and also the repository layer .
The service and controller layer are easly implemented once we get the filtering ideas we need.

Controller layer will be implemented with Rest and the UI will listen to the mapping required.
An example of this will be found for the bill.


TODOS:
create the appropriate functionalities in the repo and brach out to the controller layer as seen in Bill

Find / implement suitable design pattern -
1 . Factory for the User Employee
2 . Command for the UI
anything else
//Create and make mysql
